Description: Identifies a bicluster of a data matrix, clustering observations and features simultaneously, and apply sparsity to features. 'SpcvxBic' can be used for high-dimensional data, identifies uninformative features. The method is based on Bi-ADMM algorithm. For a detailed introduction to this algorithm, please refer to the author's related papers.
